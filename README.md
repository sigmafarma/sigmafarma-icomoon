# Sigmafarma Icomoon

This project exposes the Icommon font for Sigmafarma projects. It icludes the icons defined in the Sigmafarma Design Sytem.

## Usage

### Install via React Component Library (SigmaFarmaIcon component)

Follow the instructions in the [Sigmafarma Component Library](https://components.sigmafarma.es/components/icons/sigma-farma-icon) to install the component and use the icons.

### Use the Icomoon font directly

You can add the Icomoon font to your project by adding the following line to your HTML file:

```html
<!--current verion-->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://sigmafarma.github.io/sigmafarma-icomoon/v1.0/style.css"> 
```

Then you can use the icons in your HTML code like this:

```html

<i class="icon icon-name"></i>
```

Versions are not deleted, so you can use the version you need by changing the version number in the URL. For example, to use version 1.0 of the font, you can use the following URL:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://sigmafarma.github.io/sigmafarma-icomoon/v1.0/style.css">
```

Where `icon-name` is the name of the icon you want to use. You can find the list of available icons in the [Sigmafarma Icomoon demo page](https://sigmafarma.github.io/sigmafarma-icomoon/v1.0/demo.html).
